      12 Warrants that may be issued under this Chapter

        (1) There are three kinds of warrant that may be issued under this Chapter—
          (a) targeted interception warrants (see subsection (2)),
          (b) targeted examination warrants (see subsection (3)), and
          (c) mutual assistance warrants (see subsection (4)).

        (2) A targeted interception warrant is a warrant which authorises or requires the person to whom it is addressed to secure, by any conduct described in the warrant, any one or more of the following—
          (a) the interception, in the course of their transmission by means of a postal service or telecommunication system, of the communications described in the warrant;
          (b) the obtaining of related communications data from communications described in the warrant (see subsection (6));
          (c) the disclosure, in any manner described in the warrant, of intercepted material or related communications data obtained under the warrant to the person to whom the warrant is addressed or to any person acting on that person’s behalf.

        (3) A targeted examination warrant is a warrant which authorises the person to whom it is addressed to carry out the examination of intercepted material obtained under a bulk interception warrant.
            For provision about bulk interception warrants, see Chapter 1 of Part 6.

        (4) A mutual assistance warrant is a warrant which authorises or requires the person to whom it is addressed to secure, by any conduct described in the warrant, any one or more of the following—
          (a) the making of a request, in accordance with an EU mutual assistance instrument or an international mutual assistance agreement, for the provision of any assistance of a kind described in the warrant in connection with, or in the form of, an interception of communications;
          (b) the provision to the competent authorities of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom, in accordance with such an instrument or agreement, of any assistance of a kind described in the warrant in connection with, or in the form of, an interception of communications;
          (c) the disclosure, in any manner described in the warrant, of any intercepted material or related communications data obtained under the warrant to the person to whom the warrant is addressed or to any person acting on that person’s behalf.

        (5) A targeted interception warrant or mutual assistance warrant also authorises the following conduct (in addition to the conduct described in the warrant)—
          (a) any conduct which it is necessary to undertake in order to do what is expressly authorised or required by the warrant, including—
            (i) the interception of communications not described in the warrant, and
            (ii) conduct for obtaining related communications data from such communications;
          (b) any conduct by any person which is conduct in pursuance of a requirement imposed by or on behalf of the person to whom the warrant is addressed to be provided with assistance in giving effect to the warrant.

        (6) In this Part “related communications data” means—
          (a) in relation to a communication intercepted in the course of its transmission by means of a postal service, data falling within subsection (7);
          (b) in relation to a communication intercepted in the course of its transmission by means of a telecommunication system, data falling within subsection (7) or (8).

        (7) The data falling within this subsection is so much of any data as is obtained by, or in connection with, the interception and—
          (a) is communications data relating to the communication or to the sender or recipient, or intended recipient, of the communication, or
          (b) is comprised in, included as part of, attached to or logically associated with the communication (whether by the sender or otherwise) and enables or otherwise facilitates the functioning of—
            (i) a postal service,
            (ii) a telecommunication system (including any apparatus forming part of the system), or
            (iii) any telecommunications service provided by means of a telecommunication system.
          For the meaning of “communications data”, see sections 193 and 194.

        (8) The data falling within this subsection is so much of the content of the communication (see section 193(6)) as—
          (a) is capable of being logically separated from the remainder of the content of the communication, and
          (b) if it were so separated—
            (i) would not reveal anything of what might reasonably be expected to be the meaning of the communication, disregarding any meaning arising from the fact of the communication or from any data relating to the transmission of the communication, and
            (ii) would be data falling within subsection (9).
        (9) The data falling within this subsection is—
          (a) data which may be used to identify, or assist in identifying, any person, apparatus, telecommunication system or telecommunications service, and
          (b) data which describes an event or the location of any person, event or thing.

        (10) For provision enabling the combination of targeted interception warrants with certain other warrants or authorisations (including targeted examination warrants), see Schedule 7.
