    Abolition of powers to obtain communications data

    9 Abolition of certain powers to obtain data

      (1) Schedule 2 (which repeals certain general information powers so far as they enable public authorities to secure the disclosure by a telecommunications operator or postal operator of communications data without the consent of the operator) has effect.

      (2) Any general information power which—
        (a) would (apart from this subsection) enable a public authority to secure the disclosure by a telecommunications operator or postal operator of communications data without the consent of the operator, and
        (b) does not involve a court order or other judicial authorisation or warrant and is not a regulatory power, is to be read as not enabling the public authority to secure such a disclosure.

      (3) A regulatory power which enables a public authority to secure the disclosure by a telecommunications operator or postal operator of communications data without the consent of the operator may only be exercised by the public authority if it is not possible for the authority to use a power under this Act to secure the disclosure of the data.

      (4) The Secretary of State may by regulations modify any enactment in consequence of subsection (2).

      (5) In this section “general information power” means—
        (a) in relation to disclosure by a telecommunications operator, any power to obtain information or documents (however expressed) which—
          (i) is conferred by or under an enactment other than this Act or the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, and
          (ii) does not deal (whether alone or with other matters) specifically with telecommunications operators or any class of telecommunications operators, and
        (b) in relation to disclosure by a postal operator, any power to obtain information or documents (however expressed) which—
          (i) is conferred by or under an enactment other than this Act or the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, and (ii) does not deal (whether alone or with other matters) specifically with postal operators or any class of postal operators.

      (6) In this section—
        “power” includes part of a power;
        “regulatory power” means any general information power to obtain information or documents for the purpose of exercising regulatory functions in relation to telecommunications services or postal services, and references to powers include duties (and references to enabling are accordingly to be read as including references to requiring).
