Bulk Powers Case Study

A group of terrorists were planning a firearms-based attack in the UK. The group had links to known terrorists overseas and as such the threat which they posed was credible. Close monitoring of the group by the police and intelligence agencies was necessary to ensure that their plans could be disrupted.

The ability to access communications data in bulk was critical to averting this plot. Using communications data, the agencies were quickly able to obtain identifying details for members of the group without needing to resort to more intrusive powers. With the network successfully identified, the intelligence agencies and police were able to put targeted disruptive measures in place to prevent this attack occurring.
