Interception Case Study: Serious Crime Investigation

A criminal investigation was underway into a pattern of escalating violence between a number of rival organised crime groups, including street gangs linked to the London drug economy, operating across the capital.

Intelligence derived from interception indicated a conflict between organised crime groups as each sought to control a greater section of the drugs market, and intelligence suggested the use of firearms by the groups. This prompted immediate steps to tackle the groups, with the intention of dismantling the network, disrupting the supply of Class A drugs, preventing further loss of life and arresting those involved.

Intercepted material identified the individual co-ordinating the sale of significant amounts of Class A drugs, led to the location of his safe storage premises, and identified senior gang members involved in the supply chain. It also enabled junior gang members to be identified as couriers of the drugs to numerous locations across London, the Home Counties and beyond, including the method and timing of transport. Interception also revealed that the head of the organised crime group was conspiring with others to shoot a rival. This led to the subject of interest being arrested while he was en route to the hit location. He was found to be in possession of a loaded firearm.

The operation led to the collapse of the network operating across London and a number of other counties. During the course of the operation, intelligence from interception led to the seizure of over 40 firearms, in excess of 200kg of Class A drugs, the seizure of over Â£500,000 of cash and over 100 arrests.
