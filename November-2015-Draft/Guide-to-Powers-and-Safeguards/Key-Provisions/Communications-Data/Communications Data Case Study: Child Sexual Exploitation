Communications Data Case Study: Child Sexual Exploitation

Operation GLOBE was a South Wales Police investigation in late 2012, into the sexual offences against children by Ian Watkins, lead singer of rock band Lostprophets. The investigation went on to show that Watkins was engaged in serious sexual offences against children, including the babies of two female co-defendants.

In the early stages of the inquiry neither child had any physical injuries consistent with sexual abuse; there were no witnesses and no substantive evidence to support charges for the serious sexual offences that were suspected. Communications data was used alongside other investigative techniques which identified a clear conspiracy between all three defendants to abuse children sexually.

During the course of the investigation, officers seized electronic devices belonging to Watkins and recovered emails that contained indecent images of children. In one case, communications data was used to identify the sender of emails containing child abuse images and to establish the physical address of one of the co-defendants, who was subsequently arrested and her 16-month old daughter taken into care.

At court, the prosecution case relied on evidence of phone contacts, movements and messaging between five key mobile telephone numbers. Subscriber checks had been made against these numbers to establish names and links. Historic communications data was also used to demonstrate the movement of devices attributed to the defendants and show that they were consistent with conversations that took place between them.

Watkins pleaded guilty and in December 2013 was sentenced to 35 years. Two codefendants, who were mothers of babies sexually abused by Watkins, also pleaded guilty and received sentences of 17 years and 14 years. Their identities have not been revealed as the names of the child victims are protected by law and consequently so are the mothers.
