Equipment Interference Case Study: Attempted Murder

Equipment interference, when used with other intelligence gathering techniques, is vital in time-limited cases of threat-to-life when the police need to act quickly.

In one example, intelligence was received that several suspects were at large after being involved in an attempted murder. Equipment interference and other intelligence gathering techniques were used to identify and locate the suspects leading to their arrest before further offences could be committed. Due to the intelligence acquired through equipment interference, the suspects were arrested within hours of receiving the initial intelligence. Without the use of equipment interference it would not have been possible to arrest the suspects simultaneously which was critical to preserving the evidence.
