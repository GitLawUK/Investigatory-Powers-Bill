CONSULTATION

  The draft Investigatory Powers Bill will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of Parliament. The Committee will issue its own call for evidence and will invite views from the public and interested parties.

  The Government welcomes views on the issues covered in the draft Bill and will continue to engage with industry, academia and civil liberties groups throughout the prelegislative scrutiny period. If you would like to share your views on any of the issues addressed in the draft Bill directly with the Government rather than the Joint Committee, please contact us at: investigatorypowers@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk.
